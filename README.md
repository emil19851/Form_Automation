# Form_Automation

This is a simple project for trying out Selenium together with TestNG.

Remember to change the CHROME_DRIVER_LOCATION variable in the Utils class to match the path to the chromedriver path on your computer.

The chromedriver.exe which is included in the project is for Google Chrome version 101 only. If you are using another version of Google Chrome or if you are on a Mac, please download the appropiate version from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
